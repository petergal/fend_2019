  <h1>add an image</h1>




  <!--
  Sample image element:

      <img src="http://somewebsite.com/image.jpg" alt="short description">

  How to complete this quiz:

  * Create an image element at the designated spot in the paragraph below.
  * Set the source to: http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png
  * Set the alt description to a quick description of the image (maybe something like, "Udacity logo").
  * Play around with the URL! See if you can make a different image appear.

  <p>
    This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. Cool. Cool. And here is an image!
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/St._Bernard_puppy.jpg" alt="Udacity logo"/> Here's another question for you: how is the text reacting to the image? Is the image on its own line or is it showing up in the same last as the rest of the text?
