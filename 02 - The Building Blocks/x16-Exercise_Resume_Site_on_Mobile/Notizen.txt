Why is the image covered? Why is the text so small?

Your team has been tasked with taking the existing page design and making it mobile friendly using CSS breakpoints.

Once you have downloaded the source code, view the code in your browser using Developer Tools.


You need to add 2 breakpoints to the lab using media queries. One for a tablet (such as the iPad) and one for a mobile phone (such as an iPhone).

  - The desktop version of the site will have a 3-column layout. The resume will have a “sidebar” for the headings “Jenna Garcia”, “Projects”, and “Work”.

  - The tablet version will have a 2-column layout. The resume headings will be placed above each section in the resume.

  - The mobile version will completely hide Jenna’s photo, focusing on just the information displayed in the resume.

Some other notes:

  - Place both breakpoints at the bottom of your CSS file.

  - You want the site to be responsive at other widths outside of the set breakpoints, so be sure to modify any fixed-widths that are preventing the site from being mobile.

  - Verify that the device-width is being used for the size of the viewport.
